                <p class="text-secondary">Named after the man who shot Achilles' Heel to take him down,
                    Paris is an app to solve my personal Achilles Heel: working from home.
                    I built Paris so you can set a location that
                    you want to be at by a certain time, and then be at that location by that time â€” or else you are
                    charged $10. I used this to force myself to get out of the house on weekdays and weekends to go to
                    the library where I'm much more productive. </p>
                <p class="text-secondary">The app is written in React Native with a NodeJS back end and MongoDB
                    database. This was the first app I built using React Native! The back end is abstracted so you
                    can specify whether you want to make sure you are or
                    are not at a certain location, set which days of the week this should happen, set how large the
                    buffer distance and time is, and more.</p>
