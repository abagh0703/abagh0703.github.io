                    various aspects of the lecture, such as the volume and pace. Professors, on the other hand, get an
                    opportunity to receive live feedback on their teaching style and also give students a few warm-up
                    exercises with a built-in clicker functionality. Students receive live transcripts of what the
                    professor is currently saying, along with a summary at the end of the lecture which includes key
                    points. The backend will also generate further reading material based on keywords from the
                    lecture.</p>

                    award for best Education Hack. I did full stack work on this project, writing front-end React code
                    as well as custom Python modules to facilitate the client-server interaction.</p>
