                    this, but it's a rare moment where I have a great image so I thought I'd include it! I was the lead
                    course instructor for a course we taught to Cornell students about full stack web development. We
                    taught about React, NodeJS, and Firebase. I worked alongside the other instructors in creating
                    slides and assignments as well as holding office hours. (Note that the course website below was made
                    by the instructors after me.)
