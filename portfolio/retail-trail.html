                <p class="text-secondary">Retail Trail was a website that showed users the inventory of retail stores
                    near them. For example, if a user needed a bottle opener, they could search retail trail to see
                    which retails stores near them have it and then go buy it from that store.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">This was made during a hackathon with a friend. I worked on the front-end and
                    some of the back-end. We used Flask and PostgreSQL for the back end + database respectively. </p>
