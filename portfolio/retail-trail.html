                <p class="text-secondary">Retail Trail was a website that showed users the inventory of retail stores
                    near them. For example, if a user bought tuna but doesn't have a can opener and really wanted to
                    eat that tuna, they could search Retail Trail to see
                    which retails stores near them have it and then go buy it from that store. That way they wouldn't
                have to wait two days for it to arrive if ordered online or go to a 7/11 only to find out they don't have
                can openers.</p>
                <p class="text-secondary">This was made during a hackathon with a friend. I worked on the front-end and
                    some of the back-end. We used Flask and PostgreSQL for the back end + database respectively. </p>
